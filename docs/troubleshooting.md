# Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues and Solutions

### 1. Application Fails to Start

**Symptoms:**
- Docker container exits immediately after starting
- Error messages in logs about missing environment variables

**Possible Solutions:**
- Check if all required environment variables are set in the `.env` file
- Verify that the `.env` file is in the correct location and is being read by the container
- Check Docker logs for specific error messages:
  ```
  docker logs robinbots
  ```

### 2. API Connection Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Error messages about failed API requests
- Unexpected `None` values in stock data

**Possible Solutions:**
- Verify Robinhood API credentials in the `.env` file
- Check internet connectivity on the server
- Ensure you're not exceeding API rate limits
- Verify that the Robinhood API is operational

### 3. Unexpected Trading Behavior

**Symptoms:**
- Trades are not executed as expected
- Unusual buy/sell signals

**Possible Solutions:**
- Review the logs for any warnings or errors
- Check if the analysis parameters in `config.py` are set correctly
- Verify that the historical data being used is accurate and up-to-date
- Ensure that the risk management settings are appropriate

### 4. Performance Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Slow response times
- High CPU or memory usage

**Possible Solutions:**
- Check system resources using `docker stats robinbots`
- Review and optimize database queries if applicable
- Consider scaling up the server resources
- Analyze logs for any operations taking unusually long time

### 5. Data Inconsistencies

**Symptoms:**
- Mismatched data between different parts of the application
- Unexpected `NaN` values in calculations

**Possible Solutions:**
- Verify data sources and ensure they're reliable
- Check for any data transformation errors in the code
- Ensure that timezone handling is consistent throughout the application
- Review data cleaning and preprocessing steps

### 6. Scheduling Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Tasks not running at expected times
- Missed trading opportunities

**Possible Solutions:**
- Check if the server time is set correctly
- Review the cron job configurations
- Ensure that the BackgroundScheduler is running properly
- Check logs for any errors related to scheduled tasks

### 7. Docker-related Issues

**Symptoms:**
- Container stops unexpectedly
- Unable to access files or directories

**Possible Solutions:**
- Check Docker logs: `docker logs robinbots`
- Verify file permissions for mounted volumes
- Ensure there's enough disk space on the host machine
- Check if the Docker daemon is running properly

## Debugging Steps

1. **Check Logs:**
   - Application logs: `docker exec robinbots cat /app/logs/app.log`
   - Docker logs: `docker logs robinbots`

2. **Verify Configurations:**
   - Review `.env` file for correct settings
   - Check `config.py` for proper parameters

3. **Test API Connectivity:**
   - Use a tool like Postman to test API endpoints
   - Verify API credentials and permissions

4. **Analyze Data:**
   - Use Jupyter Notebook to analyze historical data
   - Check for data integrity and consistency

5. **Monitor System Resources:**
   - Use `docker stats robinbots` to monitor container resource usage
   - Check host machine resources with `top` or `htop`

6. **Review Code:**
   - Use debugging tools in your IDE
   - Add additional logging for problematic areas

7. **Test in Isolation:**
   - Run specific components separately to isolate issues
   - Use mock data to test analysis and decision-making logic

If problems persist after trying these solutions, consider reaching out to the development team or consulting the project's issue tracker on GitHub.
