# Development Guide

## Setting Up the Development Environment

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/robinBots.git
   cd robinBots
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install development dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
   ```

4. Set up pre-commit hooks:
   ```
   pre-commit install
   ```

## Code Style and Linting

We use Black for code formatting and Flake8 for linting. Run these before committing:

```
black .
flake8
```

## Running Tests

Use pytest to run the test suite:

```
pytest
```

For test coverage report:

```
pytest --cov=src tests/
```

## Adding New Features

1. Create a new branch for your feature:
   ```
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Implement your feature, adding tests as necessary.

3. Update documentation in the `docs/` directory.

4. Commit your changes:
   ```
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add your feature description"
   ```

5. Push your branch and create a pull request on GitHub.

## Modifying Trading Strategies

When modifying trading strategies:

1. Update the `analyze_stock()` function in `src/analysis.py`.
2. Adjust risk management parameters in `src/risk_management.py`.
3. If adding new technical indicators, implement them in `src/indicators.py`.
4. Update the decision making logic in `src/decision_engine.py`.

## Working with the Robinhood API

- All Robinhood API interactions should go through the `RobinhoodClient` class in `src/robinhood_client.py`.
- Implement proper error handling and rate limiting.
- Use environment variables for sensitive information like API keys.

## Debugging Tips

- Use logging extensively. Import the logger from `src/logger.py`.
- For complex issues, use the Python debugger (pdb) or an IDE debugger.
- Monitor system performance using the built-in profiling tools.

## Contribution Guidelines

- Follow the PEP 8 style guide.
- Write clear, self-documenting code with appropriate comments.
- Include unit tests for all new features.
- Update the documentation for any user-facing changes.
- Be responsive to code review comments.

Remember, the goal is to maintain a robust and efficient trading system. Always consider the implications of your changes on the overall system performance and reliability.
